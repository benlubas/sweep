# Sweep

This is my keymap repo for the tiny little keybaord that I use called the Ferris Sweep. 

The keyboard is 34 keys, split and column staggered. It's got choc switches, and it's fully wireless. 

I'll add a picture at some point, but for now, just go look up "ferris sweep" there are plenty of examples on reddit. 

After about a week of using this thing I've decided that I like chording and sticky layer better than permenant layer toggles. But that might change at any time. 

### Typeing Speed

I will also say that after about a week I'm back up to about 80% of my average typing speed on a normal keyboard in general typing (for context, normal speed is just under 100 wpm). For programming I'm still at like 60% of what I can do on a mac keyboard. This speed is still good enough for me to use though. I don't feel like it hinders me too too much, and I can clearly see myself improving daily. 

### Firmware 

The firmware that powers this keyboard is called ZMK, and it's amazing. The firmware in conjunction with the four thumb keys allow for some functionality that most keyboards don't even have. For example, having the arrow keys on hjkl, or putting ctrl + backspace on one key for really quick error corrections. Additionally, because I've got layers, each symbol has it's key, which can be nice for things like +=  

### Why?

This thing is super portable and ergonomic. On top of that. It's really cool, isn't it? 

I mean, it's not super important for a keyboard to be portable. But it's just nice to have.

I won't go too in depth about ergonomics. But having a split keyboard it good for ergonomics. Additionally, not having to reach for keys makes for a more comfortable typing experience. The furthest you have to reach any finger is only one key away. 

Tell me that this doesn't look sick, and then go watch someone type on it and tell me that it's not satisfying. 

### Homerow Mods Suck

I didn't like the homerow mods that were on the default ferris layout that I tried. There's like 0 chance that I'll ever go back. I was accidentally triggering them all the time.
