# sweep

This is my keymap repo for the tiny little keybaord that I use called the Ferris Sweep. 

The keyboard is 34 keys, split and column staggered. It's got choc switches, and it's fully wireless. 

There's a little bit of a learning curve when you first start using a board like this (obviously). With only 34 keys, you don't have space for keys like tab, backspace, or enter. Even the shift keys, which are used all the time, are gone. 
In their place, there are layers, mod tap, and extra thumb keys. Basically, we make up for all of those missing keys with some fancy firmware called ZMK. This lets me use my z key as a shift key when it's held down. Z isn't used that often anyway, I'm really just using my shift key as a Z key sometimes. 

There's also no numblayer. or backspace, or arrows. But if I tap my left thumb key, I get a numpad under my left hand and a cluster of arrows under my left. 

That "layer" is toggleable. That means that I hit one key once and I'm in that layer untill I hit a different key to get out. That's cool and all, but it's not the best for everything. My symbol layer is on a "momentary" layer toggel. So if I want a symbol, I hold down my rightmost thumb key and I can type !@#$\*() and all the other symbols that are on a normal keyboard. 

At the time that I'm typing this, I haven't yet made a function layer, with F1-F12 keys. I also haven't added different profiles for windows and mac. This profile is made for mac, and that's extremely apparernt when I don't have a controll key on the board.
