# Sweep

This is my keymap repo for the tiny little keybaord that I use called the Ferris Sweep. 

The keyboard is 34 keys, split and column staggered. It's got choc switches, and it's fully wireless. 

I'll add a picture at some point, but for now, just go look up "ferris sweep" there are plenty of examples on reddit. 

the master branch is a little old. look at the toggle layers branch for what I actually use on this. 


### Why?

This thing is super portable and ergonomic. On top of that. It's really cool, isn't it? 

I mean, it's not super important for a keyboard to be portable. But it's just nice to have.

SUUUUPPPER satesfying to type on this. It's so comfortable with very little effort. It also sounds so much better than my laptop keyboard. 
### Homerow Mods Suck

I didn't like the homerow mods that were on the default ferris layout that I tried. There's like 0 chance that I'll ever go back. I was accidentally triggering them all the time.
