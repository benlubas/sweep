toggling layers was okay for a bit. but there are some things that I still don't like. 

with only 34 keys, getting back to the home layer is under my space key. Which is bad for typing things like "1, 2, 3," bc it's left thumb, right pinky, 1 space comma space, and so on. It's a lot of keypresses to output numbers mixed in with symbols, and especially when I'm using vim on top of that. it's awful. and I spend too much time thinking about what keys to hit. (this is after less than a month of being on the toggle layers layout though. So I think eventually I would get used to it. But it's still slower than it has to be. I think that I'm going to make another branch off this one that makes a few modifications.
